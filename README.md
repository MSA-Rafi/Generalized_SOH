# Generalized_SOH
This study introduces a novel ODS-ABiLSTM and PCS-ABiLSTM-driven deep learning framework, integrated with an energy discrepancyâ€“aware data warping and grid-based encoding mechanism, to enable generalized and transferable state-of-health (SOH) estimation across heterogeneous battery datasets.
